## Project A: Generate 3D Objects
**[View It Here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/zhtiansweet/3DSpace_EECS351/blob/master/ZhangTianProjA.html)**  
The animation area is on the top, following by four buttons, and the user guide is on the bottom. A user could press F1 + fn (Mac) or F1 (Windows) to print the detailed user guide.  

As for the animation, there is a flower and a child on each side of a board, and they spin around the y axis as a whole. The flower consists of four tetrahedrons as petals and a sphere as the stamen, and rotates around the z axis. The child consists of seven cuboids as his arms (upper and lower), the body and legs, and a cube as his head. His legs and arms spin around his body with different angles. All movable segments move smoothly and continuously. Besides, each single object has vertices of various colors.  

The user could click on the animation or the “Run/Stop” button to run/stop it. When the user drag with mouse on the animation, the angle of view will changes. The user can also press the up/down/left/right-arrow key to move the objects. The “Spin<<” and “Spin>>” buttons are used to modify the speed of the animation. With the “Reset” button, the user could easily restore the default angle, location and speed.
## Project B: Explore 3D Space

The two view ports are on the top, following by the user guide on the bottom. A user could press F1 + fn (Mac) or F1 (Windows) to print the detailed user guide. The left view port shows a perspective image, while the right one shows an orthographic image. When the browser is resized, the two view ports could keep filling the full screen without any distortion.

There are five objects in the scene, including two movable objects, the “flower” and the “child” and three fixed objects. The child has ten segments and six joints (shoulders, elbows and wrists). All the objects are multi-colored.

The ground plane of the “world” is filled with cross grids.

The user can explore the 3D world by going or looking in any directions. Every point in the scene is accessible, and the view angle can be changed smoothly and continuously.
